\begin{abstract}
Nanite is Unreal Engine's virtualized geometry system which uses a new internal mesh format and rendering technology to produce pixel scale detail and high object counts. It intelligently does work on only the detail that can be perceived an no more. Nanite's data format is also highly compressed, and supports fine-grained streaming with automatic level of detail
