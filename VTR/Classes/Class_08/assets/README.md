# Note

This directory is where the .obj and .mtl files are stored. Given that Github limits the space of personal repositories these files aren't present in the repo.

### Note:

In this class we take advantage of one of NAU's functionalities. That beeing said, NAU has already some base primitives in it's system so there is no need of a .obj to create the sphere to be textured.
